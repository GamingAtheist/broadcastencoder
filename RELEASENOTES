OBE-RT 0.1-Beta Release Notes

** Suitability **

This release is suitable for long term testing in an IPTV lab or production environment.
It has been tested on SD/HD streams on a production IPTV network. Only obecli use is recommended. API use is not recommended.

** Known issues **

Handling of SDI drops is not optimal. This will be fixed in a later release.

There is a condition with x264's lookahead that can cause some small speedcontrol underflows.
(A speedcontrol underflow is when the encoder runs slower than realtime for a short period).
The total underflow time is generally very small and within ip jitter tolerances. This will
be fixed in a later release.

IP-in -> IP-out transcoding is an experimental feature
